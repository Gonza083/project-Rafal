# project-Rafal

Description
This project has been designed to separate and work independently on the frontend code (html/css/javascript) without direct access to the backend. The architecture has been modified to ensure that the frontend and backend remain separated and can evolve independently.

Features
Frontend Connected Routes: All required routes are set up to connect to the frontend, allowing for smooth integration with the backend when necessary.

Simple Test Template: To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, I've created a test template that showcases how the frontend would interact with the backend using a simulated context.

Simulated Context: I've implemented a simulated context that can be found in the template tags folder, giving developers a hands-on example of how data would be managed in a real-life scenario.
